Greetings fellow internet traveller! I'm t3chyy, I'm an 18 year old cybersecurity enthusiast interested in penetration testing & occassional malware development. I also dabble around in other things, including EAS & NOAA weather radios, programming, and gaming.

When I'm not on the computer, I like to go bowling and hang out with my family (appreciate your family guys)

# Coding Projects

Here are some projects I've made over the years, most of them are incredibly random ideas or just stuff I made for the hell of it. Check them out!

| Icon | Year | Name | Description | 
| :------------------- | :---------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| <img src="../wxmod.png" style="width:150px;"/> | 2022 | **The Weather Radio Mod** | A Minecraft mod that adds a various selection of NOAA weather radios in-game. Anyone involved in the EAS/WX niche can now enjoy the satisfaction of being able to collect, obtain & own rare weather radios in the world of Minecraft! |
| <img src="../stringgen.png" style="width:150px;"/>| 2021 | **StringGen** | A very simple random string generator written in C#, uses your own compute for string generation so there's no quota limit (fuck random.org) |
| <img src="../blizzard.png" style="width:150px;"/>| 2020 | **Blizzard** | An old Lua executor for Roblox, with the help of the old WeAreDevs API, it allowed you to execute Lua scripts onto the Roblox game client. These types of programs were commonly used to cheat/"exploit" in Roblox. **This program is no longer maintained because I no longer condone cheating in children's games.** |
|<img src="../t3chyybot.png" style="width:150px;"/>| 2020 | **T3chyy Bot** | A Discord bot written in JavaScript with exclusive moderation, weather, and music features designed for use in my old Discord server. Notable commands me & others had fun with included t!roast, t!alertmap (which gave weather.gov information for a specified area), t!say and t!hack. **As stated before, the discord server is old and no longer active, and as such, this bot is no longer maintained.**
|<img src="../impons.jpeg" style="width:150px;"/>| 2018 | **Imp-Ons** | An addon to MrCrayfish's Device Mod. It contained a Document Writer, Antivirus, and at one point, a bank app. This mod was never finished, and the Device Mod stopped receiving updates years later. **No longer maintained** |
|<img src="../sunkistingot.png" style="width:150px;"/> | 2018  | **Techyy's Sunkist Mod** | My very first coding project that I managed to finish and release to the public, I was only 11 years old. This Minecraft mod added blocks and items related to the Sunkist soda drink, including swords & axes. Although there were crafting recipes for the tools, there wasn't any way to obtain ingots in survival mode in order to craft them. **No longer maintained**|

# :warning: WALL OF CRINGEWARE :warning:

These projects listed here are either skidded off of other people's projects (yes I used to be that guy, but we've all been there.. right..? :smirk:) or I'm simpily just not proud of them, nothing listed here is being updated anymore.

Be warned.
 Year | Name | Description | 
 :---------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| 2021 | **Labyrinth** | A multi-payload trojan written in C# that contained 4 payloads, which activated on certain dates. Most of the code was taken from the ResonateII source, not only that, the jokes present in the malware weren't funny at all and just made it even more cringe. |
| 2021 | **Arceus** | Similar to Labyrinth, it was a multi-payload trojan that contained 5 payloads, written in VBS. What makes this pile of garbage stand out is the lack of any loops, it has about 200 write function calls which make the final payload (where it fills your desktop with junk files similar to Maldal) incredibly slow. |
| 2020 | **KarmaII** | The successor to Karma, Instead of Win9x, it worked for modern version of Windows and caused a little more damage by modifying registry keys. It was still garbage because once again, there wasn't any loops and the batch file that it drops was stolen from Bolbi. |
| 2020 | **Karma** | This piece of VBS junk that only works on Win9x is a skid of Rabbit (yes im talking about the first VBS virus from the 90s, point and laugh). As the message in the payload states, it only took me 15 minutes to create. All I changed was adding an if statement checking if the day and month was set to September 11th and if so, create 250 shortcuts on the desktop linking to my channel. There wasn't any looping either so looking at the code is absolutely disgusting. |
| 2018 | **InjectorUltimate (Techyyjector)** | A DLL injector written in Visual Basic (puke :nauseated_face:), These programs were used to inject modded DLLs into processes, most commonly games such as Roblox or Counter-Strike. The code in this project was entirely ripped off of a tutorial I found in 2018, If I remembered where it was I would totally leave credit here.|
